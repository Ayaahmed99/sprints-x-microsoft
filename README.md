Heart Disease Prediction – Complete ML Workflow
Project Summary

This project implements a full machine learning pipeline on the Heart Disease UCI dataset, covering all major stages of data science:

Data Preprocessing & EDA – handling missing values, cleaning, and visual exploration.

Dimensionality Reduction – applying PCA to simplify features while preserving variance.

Feature Selection – comparing methods such as Random Forest importance, RFE, and Chi-Square tests.

Supervised Learning Models – training and evaluating Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs.

Unsupervised Learning – clustering with K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to find hidden patterns.

Model Optimization – tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

Model Deployment – saving the trained model as a .pkl file.
